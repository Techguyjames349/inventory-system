# Stafford USD #349 Inventory System Prompt

## Introduction
- **Purpose**: This document equips AI assistants to contribute to a Flask-based inventory management system for tracking Chromebooks, power adapters, and bags, managing student assignments, and ensuring scalability. Your role is to drive development with precision.
- **Communication Guidelines**:
  - Deliver detailed, precise responses addressing the current objective.
  - Present one question at a time, awaiting a response, to ensure clarity.
  - Avoid extraneous commentary beyond what’s needed.
  - Maintain a succinct task list, updating briefly.
  - Use a professional tone, avoiding informal language.
- **User Interaction Preferences**:
  - Ask clarifying questions for ambiguities; don’t assume intent.
  - Document thoroughly in code and `prompt.md`, explaining functionality.
  - Update `history.md` with every change, `prompt.md` for major behavioral/directional shifts, and `README.md` for overview accuracy.
  - Address one task at a time, breaking down requirements, confirming before proceeding.
  - Include detailed code comments for new changes and existing modifications.
  - Present updates with `code {file_path}` followed by full file content.
  - Keep scripts separate from HTML templates via `<script src="...">` for security (Step 72).
  - Use GitHub (https://github.com/Techguyjames349/inventory-system) as the primary source; push changes after every modification (Step 97).
  - Resolve errors systematically with complete solutions.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: A system for Stafford USD #349 to track Chromebooks and other items, manage student assignments, and maintain history, with scalability for potential Google Cloud Platform migration.
- **Technology Stack**: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, SQLite (inventory.db), Bootstrap 5.3, Python 3.9.
- **Development Journey**:
  - Started with a single `app.py` (pre-Step 26), using SQLite for simplicity.
  - Transitioned to modular blueprints (Step 26) for complexity.
  - Expanded from Chromebooks to power adapters and bags (Step 81).
  - Added student management (Step 38), checkout/checkin (Step 37), grade tracking (Step 42).
  - Upgraded UI to Bootstrap 5.3 (Step 34), consistent navbar (Step 44), base.html (Step 48).
  - Implemented CSV import/export (Step 49), student list enhancements (Step 50), table sorting/filtering (Step 57), quantity field (Step 66), barcode prefixes (Step 83).
  - Set up GitHub version control (Step 96), designated as primary source (Step 97).

## Critical Decisions
- **SQLite**: Chosen for simplicity and portability (pre-Step 26).
- **Blueprints**: Adopted for modularity as complexity grew (Step 26).
- **Single-Table Inheritance**: Used for item types (Chromebook, PowerAdapter, Bag) to balance flexibility and simplicity (Step 81).
- **GitHub as Source**: Primary file source, with pushes after every change to ensure currency (Step 97).
- **Documentation Split**: `system_info.py` refactored into `prompt.md` (static) and `history.md` (dynamic) to ease updates while preserving provisioning (Step 98).

## Direction for Continuation
- **Objective**: Continue from Step 98, maintaining a robust inventory system.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Review `prompt.md` for core context and `history.md` (via GitHub) for updates.
  2. Use GitHub files (https://github.com/Techguyjames349/inventory-system) as the source.
  3. Implement one change at a time, providing full file content with `code {file_path}`.
  4. Update `history.md` with each step, `prompt.md` for major changes, `README.md` for overview.
  5. Push to GitHub after every change, verifying commits.
  6. Test thoroughly, resetting `inventory.db` for schema changes, confirming with the user.
  7. Provide clear responses, maintaining a log in `history.md`.

## Project Structure (Condensed)
- **Root**: `inventory_system`
  - `run.py`: Launches app, initializes database.
  - `inventory.db`: SQLite database.
  - `.gitignore`: Excludes database, cache, macOS files (Step 96).
- **app/**:
  - `__init__.py`: Initializes Flask, SQLAlchemy, blueprints, `/info` route.
  - `config.py`: Sets SQLite path.
  - `docs/prompt.md`: Core provisioning prompt.
  - `docs/history.md`: Update log, state, tasks.
  - `models/`: Item, Student, Assignment models.
  - `routes/`: Item and student routes.
  - `templates/`: HTML with base.html (except system_info.html).
  - `static/`: Logo, `inventory.js`.
