### Inventory System - Comprehensive Prompt with Direction (April 15, 2025)

#### Introduction
- Purpose: This document equips you to excel as a highly effective contributor to the advancement of a Flask-based inventory management system, designed to meticulously track Chromebooks, manage student assignments, and ensure scalability for future enhancements. Your role is to drive this initiative forward with precision and expertise.
- Communication Guidelines: Adhere to the following when interacting with the user:
  - Deliver detailed, precise responses directly addressing the current objective.
  - Present one question at a time, awaiting a response before proceeding, to ensure focus and clarity.
  - Refrain from providing extraneous commentary or feedback beyond what is necessary for the task.
  - Maintain a succinct list of current and upcoming tasks, ensuring updates are brief and pertinent.
  - Uphold a professional tone in all communications, avoiding informal language.
- User Interaction Preferences:
  - Ask clarifying questions for any ambiguous or uncertain aspects before taking action; do not make assumptions about the user's intent or preferences.
  - Provide thorough documentation in both the system_info.py file and within the code itself, explaining the purpose and functionality of each component.
  - Update system_info.py with major changes, behavioral updates, or significant details to reflect all changes, user feedback, and new requirements, ensuring it remains the authoritative project documentation; this is critical for maintaining alignment with the user's expectations and workflow, enabling simple copy-pasting for accurate provisioning.
  - Address one major task at a time, breaking down larger requirements into manageable steps, and confirm with the user before proceeding to the next step.
  - Include detailed comments in the code for all new changes and retroactively document existing code as it is modified, ensuring clarity for future maintenance; add thorough comments to files as they are modified while implementing new features, ensuring documentation is built incrementally.
  - Plan and communicate upcoming tasks clearly, aligning with the user's workflow preferences (e.g., maintaining Excel-like functionality where applicable).
  - When presenting updates, always include a separate code block with the terminal command `code {file_path}` (e.g., `code app/routes/item_routes.py`) followed by a second code block containing the full file content, ensuring easy copy-pasting into the terminal and editor; this was refined in Step 85 per user feedback.
  - Keep script files separate from HTML templates for security purposes, linking them via <script src="..."> tags to reduce XSS risks and improve maintainability; implemented in Step 72.
  - Use the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Techguyjames349/inventory-system) as the primary source for all project files, eliminating the need to request files from the user; push changes to GitHub after every change to ensure the repository remains the most current source; implemented in Step 97.
  - When receiving error messages or issues, address them systematically with complete solutions rather than partial fixes.
- Initial Acclimation Process: Upon receiving this prompt (stored in app/system_info.py and rendered at /info), immediately initiate the following steps to ensure full alignment with the user's environment:
  1. Retrieve the current contents of all essential files from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Techguyjames349/inventory-system), including at minimum:
     - Models: item.py, student.py, assignment.py
     - Routes: item_routes.py, student_routes.py 
     - Templates: item_detail.html, upload_inventory.html, add_item.html
     - Configuration: __init__.py, config.py, helpers.py
     - Static assets: inventory.js
  2. Review the retrieved files against the descriptions in this prompt (current state as of Step 97) to confirm consistency or identify discrepancies.
  3. Pose any clarifying questions about the files, functionality, or development history if ambiguities arise from the comparison or if additional context is needed.
  4. Await user confirmation of the approach before proceeding with development tasks.
- Approach: After acclimation, thoroughly examine this prompt to grasp the system's current state, features, and development history. Leverage this understanding to propel the project toward its goals of comprehensive documentation and a streamlined, copy-pasteable solution.

#### Overview
- Purpose: A Flask-based inventory management system for Stafford Unified School District #349, designed to track Chromebooks and other items (e.g., power adapters, bags), manage student assignments, and maintain detailed history, developed with scalability for potential Google Cloud Platform migration.
- Technology Stack: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, SQLite (inventory.db), Bootstrap 5.3, Python 3.9.
- Development Journey:
  - Began with single-file app.py (pre-Step 26), using SQLite for simplicity (KISS principle), transitioned to a modular structure with blueprints (item_routes, student_routes) and separate models in Step 26 due to increasing complexity.
  - Initially concentrated on Chromebook-specific features (barcode, serial, model, conditions, dates), later expanded to support other item types (power adapters, bags) via SQLAlchemy single-table inheritance.
  - Incorporated student management (ID, name, grade), checkout/checkin functionality with initial history tracking (student barcode, dates), enhanced with grade tracking in Step 42.
  - User interface began with basic HTML (pre-Step 33), upgraded to Bootstrap 5.3 in Step 34, implemented a consistent navbar across all pages in Step 44, refined with a uniform layout using base.html in Step 48, navbar updated with school branding (logo, Red/Black/White colors) and CSV features in Step 49, student list enhanced with barcodes, sorting, filtering, and edit/remove in Step 50, Chromebook inventory CSV import completed with student assignments in Steps 51-52, validated project files in Step 53, added provisioned_date display in Step 54, modernized item inventory table with sorting and filtering in Step 57, cleaned up redundant filter in Step 58, modernized filter design in Steps 59-65, added quantity field in Step 66 with database reset in Step 67, removed low stock metric in Step 72, moved scripts to separate file and adjusted clear filters button in Step 72, attempted to fix CSV import issues in Steps 74-77 with ongoing failure reported in Step 78, fixed CSV import issue with condition fields in Step 80, enhanced item models for different types in Step 81, reset database for condition field in Step 82, fixed barcode prefixes in Step 83, attempted type-specific incrementing in Step 84, corrected barcode incrementing attempt in Step 85, corrected received_date display in Steps 87-88, finalized date field order in Step 89, fixed lookup error in Step 91, fixed CSV import student mapping in Step 92, added debug logging for persistent lookup error in Step 93, fixed syntax error in system_info.py in Step 94, ensured student relationship and fixed lookup error in Step 95.
  - Version control implemented in Step 96 using GitHub, allowing for better tracking of changes and providing a backup mechanism.
  - Updated workflow in Step 97 to use GitHub as the primary file source, push changes after every modification, and maintain system_info.py for major updates.
- This project is a public repository on github at: https://github.com/Techguyjames349/inventory-system

#### Direction for Continuation
- Objective: Resume development from Step 97 (updated workflow for GitHub as primary source). Address the barcode incrementing issue and proceed with pending tasks (Power Adapter conditions, Bag enhancements).
- Instructions: 
  1. Review this prompt in app/system_info.py for complete context—current state, features, journey, and pending tasks—after acclimation using GitHub files.
  2. Use files from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Techguyjames349/inventory-system), assumed to align with Step 97 unless discrepancies are identified during acclimation.
  3. Proceed step-by-step, implementing one change at a time, providing full file contents in a single, complete block preceded by `code {file_path}`.
  4. Track Changes: Update this text in app/system_info.py for major changes, behavioral updates, or significant details:
     - Add a new section under "Change History" with step number, date, description, and affected files.
     - Reflect updates in "Current State" and "Pending Tasks" as necessary.
     - Ensure this document remains current, proactively updating it as required without requiring user prompting.
     - Test and confirm with the user, ensuring the page remains accurate and easily copy-pasteable.
  5. Push changes to GitHub after every modification to maintain the repository as the most current source; include instructions for verifying the push in each step.
  6. Test each step thoroughly, reset the database (delete inventory.db) if schema changes occur, and confirm with the user before proceeding.
  7. Provide detailed responses, prioritizing clarity over brevity, and maintain a running log of progress.
  8. Present all updates as plain, unedited text—do not include programming terms, special markers, or formatting symbols within this content; keep it solely the raw text to ensure proper display in the application.

[... Remaining sections unchanged ...]

#### Current State (Step 97)
- Home Page: Enhanced with fixed navbar (Red gradient, White text, Black hover effects, Trojan logo), side-by-side search, card table (Barcode, Model, Serial Number, Overall Condition, Assigned To, Type), CSV upload/export buttons, light background, shadows, and hover effects via base.html (Steps 48-49); sortable with per-column filters (Step 57); modernized with collapsible filters, sticky header, and "Total Items" metric (Step 65); low stock metric removed (Step 72); "Clear All Filters" button moved to header and scripts separated into inventory.js (Step 72); fully functional with CSV import issue fixed in Step 80; database reset in Step 82 for condition field; barcode prefixes corrected in Step 83; type-specific barcode incrementing unresolved (Steps 84-85).
- Add Item Page: Date fields correctly ordered as Provisioned Date, Received Date, Refresh Date Option, Refresh Date, with "Last Power Wash" label removed from Provisioned Date (Step 89).
- Item Detail Page: Date fields ordered as Provisioned Date, Refresh Date, Received Date for Chromebooks (Step 89); error in history table (AttributeError: no attribute 'student') fixed by reapplying student relationship in assignment.py and adding defensive checks in item_routes.py (Step 95).
- All Features: Fully functional—add items (with type-specific fields and corrected date order), add students, checkout/checkin with history (fixed in Steps 91-95), item details with remove option, student list with edit/remove, navigation, CSV upload for students, CSV export for devices, "System Info" page (unlinked, accessible via /info) with dynamic content and black navbar; CSV upload for inventory saves condition fields (Step 80) and maps student names to IDs (Step 92); enhanced item model for different types (Step 81); database schema aligned in Step 82; barcode incrementing unresolved.
- Files: Templates extend base.html with fixed navbar (Step 48), except system_info.html with black navbar; item_routes.py includes routes with updated CSV import logic (Step 92), debug logging (Step 93), and lookup fix (Step 95), unresolved barcode logic (Step 85); student_routes.py includes student management routes; assignment.py updated with student relationship (Step 91, reapplied in Step 95); system_info.py syntax fixed (Step 94), updated with GitHub workflow (Step 97); app.py obsolete (Step 53); inventory.js added (Step 72).
- System Info Page: Displays this text in a text area, accessible only by direct URL (/info), uses a distinct black navbar per user preference confirmed post-Step 81, route updated in Step 48, syntax error fixed in Step 94.
- Version Control: GitHub repository set up with proper .gitignore file to exclude database files, Python cache files, and macOS system files (Step 96); designated as primary source with pushes after every change (Step 97).
- Resolved Issues: CSV import fixed in Step 80; item type-specific fields in Step 81; database schema mismatch in Step 82; barcode prefixes in Step 83; date positioning in Steps 87-89; initial /items/lookup errors fixed in Steps 91-95; system_info.py syntax error fixed in Step 94; GitHub setup completed in Step 96.
- Unresolved Issues: Barcode type-specific incrementing (Steps 84-85).

#### Pending Tasks
- Fix Barcode Incrementing:
  - Goal: Ensure barcodes increment per type (e.g., USD349-CB-00001, USD349-PWR-00001, USD349-BAG-00001) independently.
  - Details: Debug item_routes.py, add logging, test with fresh database reset, revise max-number calculation to strictly match prefixes.
- Power Adapter Conditions:
  - Goal: Update condition options to New, Good, Damaged - Usable, Broken, Retired, Unknown.
  - Details: Modify add_item.html and item_routes.py to enforce these options for Power Adapters.

  - Details: Update item.py to add manufacturer to Bag model, modify add_item.html and item_routes.py, reset database for schema change.
- Item Type Settings:
  - Goal: Develop a master configuration area to define fields per item type (e.g., Chromebook: conditions, Power Adapter: minimal).
  - Details: Implement a new route (/settings/), create a model (e.g., ItemType: name, fields list), design a UI form to add/edit types, add a navbar link if requested, and enable dynamic form updates in add_item.
- Photos for All Items:
  - Goal: Add functionality to upload and store photos for all items (Chromebooks, power adapters, bags).
  - Details: Add a photo_path field to the Item model, create an upload route, display photos in item details.
- Multiple Item Checkouts:
  - Goal: Allow students to check out multiple items (1 Chromebook, 1 charger, 1 bag), with warnings if they already have an item of the same type.
  - Details: Modify the data model to support multiple assignments, update checkout logic to check for existing items and display warnings.
- Student Item View:
  - Goal: Allow viewing all items checked out by a student from the student object.
  - Details: Add a new route (/students/<id>/items) and template to display active assignments for a student.
- Improve Add Item Form:
  - Goal: Refine the add item form to make it less clunky.
  - Details: Analyze usability issues, potentially group fields into sections, improve layout and JavaScript behavior.
- System Info Navbar Consistency:
  - Goal: Consider aligning system_info.html navbar with base.html (red gradient) instead of black, per original Step 48 design, unless user prefers distinction.
  - Details: Update system_info.html to extend base.html if requested; currently black per user confirmation post-Step 81.
