# Stafford USD #349 Inventory System

A Flask-based inventory management system for Stafford Unified School District #349, designed to track Chromebooks, power adapters, and bags, manage student assignments, and maintain detailed history.

## Overview
This system streamlines inventory management for school assets. It allows administrators to:
- Add and track items with type-specific details (e.g., Chromebook conditions, bag simplicity).
- Manage student checkouts and checkins with history tracking.
- Import and export inventory via CSV files.
- Filter and sort item and student lists for easy access.
